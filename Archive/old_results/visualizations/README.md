# Visualization Artifacts

This directory intentionally starts empty.  Use the `comprehensive_mms_event_analysis.py`
workflow or `mms_mp.visualize.summary_single` to generate updated quick-look figures,
PNG snapshots, and CSV summaries for publication.  The repository no longer ships
stale previews so that downstream analyses always work from physics-accurate outputs.
